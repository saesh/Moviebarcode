# moviebarcode

Moviebarcode scans through a movie and adds every nth frame as a pixel bar to
a final image. The composite represents the color mood of a movie.

You will need OpenCV bindings for Python to run the scanner.

The following parameters are configurable:

- imgWidth : width of the final image
- barWidth : width to what each frame will be resized to
